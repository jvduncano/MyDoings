			<td width='70%'><p align='justify'><div class = 'f'> Ed Sheeran was born in February 1991 in Halifax, England. 
				He began playing guitar at a young age and soon after started 
				writing his own songs. When he was just a teenager, he moved 
				to London to pursue his music, and his outpouring of creativity 
				added up to several early EPs and hundreds of live shows. Drawing 
				attention for his online performances, Sheeran hit No. 1 on the
				iTunes chart before he ever signed with a record label. Since 
				signing with Atlantic, Sheeran has sold millions of records, 
				had a song appear in the second installment of The Hobbit trilogy 
				and won Grammys for hits like "Thinking Out Loud" (2014) and "Shape of You" (2017).</div></p></td>
