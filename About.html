			<td align='center' width='25%'>Who is Ed Sheeran?</td>
			<td align='justify'>Ed Sheeran was born in February 1991 in Halifax, England. He began playing guitar at a young age and soon after started writing his own songs. When he was just a teenager, he moved to London to pursue his music, and his outpouring of creativity added up to several early EPs and hundreds of live shows. Drawing attention for his online performances, Sheeran hit No. 1 on the iTunes chart before he ever signed with a record label. Since signing with Atlantic, Sheeran has sold millions of records, had a song appear in the second installment of The Hobbit trilogy and won Grammys for hits like "Thinking Out Loud" (2014) and "Shape of You" (2017).<hr></td>

Soon after, in January 2011, Sheeran released yet another EP, his last as an independent artist. Without any promotion, the record reached No. 2 on the iTunes chart, and he signed on with Atlantic Records that same month.<hr></td>

			<td align='justify'><img src='S.jpg' align='left' width='200px' height='250px'>As Sheeran's fame swelled, so did the number of cases against the Grammy-winning artist seeking compensation for copyright infringement. In 2014 songwriters Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard alleged that Sheeran's "Photograph" was ripped off from their track "Amazing," written for 2010 X Factor winner Matt Cardle. The case was settled out of court in 2017.
									<br><br>In 2016, the heirs of Ed Townsend, who co-wrote Marvin Gaye's 1973 classic "Let's Get It On, claimed that Sheeran's "Thinking Out Loud" borrowed extensively from the Gaye track. The case was dismissed the following year, but Sheeran was hit with a new lawsuit in June 2018 over the same song from Structured Asset Sales, which owned part of Townsend's catalog.
									<br><br>In early 2018, Sean Carey and Beau Golden sought $20 million in damages over claims that "The Rest of Our Life," co-written by Sheeran for country music stars Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, copied their song "When I Found You," recorded by Jasmine Rae. Calling "The Rest of Our Life" an "originally and independently created musical composition," Sheeran reportedly asked for the suit to be tossed out.<hr></td>

			<td align='center' width='25%'>Royal Honors</td>
			<td align='justify'>On December 7, 2017, Sheeran was made a member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for his services to music and charity. 
									<br><br>After receiving the honor from Prince Charles, Sheeran gushed about the occasion, but also noted it was bittersweet: "My grandfather ... he died on this day four years ago, so it's actually quite a nice full circle thing," he said, according to the prince's Twitter account. "I guess he'd be pretty proud."
									<br><br>A few weeks later, Sheeran revealed that he had celebrated another momentous occasion by getting engaged to girlfriend Cherry Seaborn just before the new year.<hr></td>

			<td align='center' width='25%'>Early Years & Career in London</td>
			<td align='justify'><img src='4.jpg' align='left' width='250px' height='150px'>Ed Sheeran was born on February 17, 1991, in Halifax, West Yorkshire, in the United Kingdom. When he was young, he began playing guitar, showing early promise as a musical talent. When he was 11, Sheeran met singer-songwriter Damien Rice backstage at one of Rice’s shows, and the young musician found added inspiration. As the story goes, Rice told Sheeran to write his own music, and Sheeran set out the next day to do just that.
									<br><br>It wasn’t long before Sheeran was recording CDs and selling them, and he soon put together his first official EP, The Orange Room. With that accomplishment and his abiding ambition driving him, at only 14 years of age, Sheeran headed to London for the summer. Thinking he could find gigs in the big city, Sheeran left home with his guitar and a backpack full of clothes, and his musical career took flight.
									<br><br>Once in London, Sheeran got busy recording and playing the local singer/songwriter circuit and quickly released two albums: a self-titled record in 2006 and Want Some? in 2007. He also began opening for more established acts, such as Nizlopi, the Noisettes and Jay Sean, and released another EP, You Need Me, in 2009, a year that found Sheeran playing more than 300 live shows.
									<br><br>It wasn’t until 2010 that Sheeran made the leap to the next level in his career, and it came via online media, a route Sheeran had learned to use with great effectiveness. When a video he posted online got the attention of Example, a rapper, Sheeran was asked to go on the road with him as his opening act. This led to an even larger online fan base and inspiration for many more songs, which ended up filling three new EPs, all in 2010.<hr></td>
